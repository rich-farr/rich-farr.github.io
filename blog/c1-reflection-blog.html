    <h1>Reflections on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h2>Friday, April 8th.</h2>
    
    <p>Firstly, I'm impressed that an organisation like EDA even exists. Education has become such a business these days that it's hard to get over the idea that they just want your $11k and don't really care what happens to you when you're done. It's also difficult to abandon that "restaurant" mindset of wanting plenty of bang for your bucks, especially when it's so many bucks. But I guess mostly, the $11k figure just motivates me to do the best I can.</p>

    <p>I love that that's important at EDA. I love that it's not about grades and tests and essays. I love that you don't have to be perfect at everything. I've always felt like a square peg in a round hole - in life in general, but also at school. Sitting in a class listening and taking notes and being graded on static output has never sat well with me. As for the culture of competitiveness, well. Let's just say I'm very much looking forward to participating in something more... enlightened.</p>

    <p>My expectations of EDA haven't really changed. The culture was made explicit in the orientation material. But it's good to have watched the video and heard the ideas in it fleshed out. Now I'm nervous for sure - can I handle the personal effort required? Can I be the person I need to be? I reckon I can do some things well already - humility, empathy, integrity, self awareness. But can I tolerate frustration? Can I reflect well enough to really cement what I've learned? Can I be mindful and persistent?</p>

    <p>The idea of pairing is new and a bit intimidating. I've always preferred working alone. But I realise it's more about those important 'soft skills', and I can always work on my in-the-moment articulation - I've always been better at expressing myself in written form rather than verbal. And I was terrible at timeboxing in my last job, so I'm looking forward to learning how to do that better.</p>

    <p>This is all so new, and weird! But I reckon that's a good thing.</p>
