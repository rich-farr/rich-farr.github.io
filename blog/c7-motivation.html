        <h3>May 19th - Search Inside Yourself Chapter 6: Motivation</h3>
        <h5>Looking through the 'Pleasure, Passion and Purpose' lens</h5>
        <p>
          It makes sense to base your life on "Purpose" and let the trickle down effect take care of the others. I'm wary of tying the concept in with work too much though - for a couple of reasons: regardless of how much I enjoy coding (and I really am enjoying it so far) I still find it difficult to align the objectives of whatever entity I work for with with my own values - ultimately I'm likely to be helping add to a corporate bottom line and when it comes down to it, that's just not a thing I care about. I could work for a non-profit I suppose, but once again their values may not match mine and you can only limit your options so much. The other reason is that I have a lot of hobbies and interests, of which coding is only one.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I take the concept as a 'whole of life' thing it becomes much more workable - I'd like to have a job that is fun and interesting and pays well, yet still allows plenty of time to pursue other things. For me, personal freedom and time is everything.
        </p>
        <h5>My core values & what I stand for</h5>
        <p>
          I'm conflating these things because I reckon they are basically the same. If you'll forgive the list format, in no particular order they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sustainability</li>
          <li>Compassion</li>
          <li>Fairness</li>
          <li>Truth</li>
          <li>Wisdom</li>
          <li>Knowledge</li>
          <li>People before profit</li>
          <li>Happiness</li>
          <li>Freedom</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>What I thought about the resilience ideas and the meditation exercise</h5>
        <p>
          The resilience stuff is all good and builds on concepts from the earlier chapters nicely. I've been more of a pessimist than an optimist in my life and I want that to change! I'd already been working on that before starting at EDA and the ideas and techniques in Chapter 6 help cement that. I wasn't aware of the 3:1 negative experience bias but man, does that make a lot of sense! Not just for me though - people in general seem quite willing to accept the cynical view on a subject if they have no experience or knowledge of it themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the Transformation idea of mindfully giving yourself credit for your success and building up a mental database of those moments to draw on when experiencing failure. It all seems to come back to mindfulness, doesn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
          The meditation exercise was difficult for me. Although it was easy enough to remember past emotions I could not "re-feel" them, so had none of the aversion or grasping they spoke of. But hey, maybe that's the state I need to be in anyway?
