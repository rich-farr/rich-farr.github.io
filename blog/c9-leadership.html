        <h3>June 1st - Search Inside Yourself Chapter 9: Leadership</h3>
        <h5>Rich's experience of compassionate leadership (and the flipside)</h5>
        <p>
          Sadly I've had way more bosses that were the opposite of this. Perhaps it's just that 3:1 negative experience bias that makes me believe that, or maybe it's because I'm difficult!
        </p>
        <p>
          My previous employer was pretty good in this regard. They genuinely care about the happiness of their employees, right down to redesigning the office based on suggestions. Even when they made a whole bunch of people redundant recently (I was one of them), they invited anyone affected by it to attend a "coping with change" workshop. They also let me bring my last day forward so that I could focus on EDA without distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was never into their "Rah rah we're changing the world" go-getter culture, but I appreciated that they really try hard to be a great place to work. When you don't much like the field you work in, that makes facing each week a whole lot easier.
        </p>
        <h5>Rich tries "Multiplying Goodness" and Tonglen meditation</h5>
        <p>
          I had difficulty with both of these. Consistent, sustained concentration on the breath is difficult enough - remembering all the steps of the techniques as well as trying to visualise "goodness", or a "dark" version of myself was just too distracting. I ended up too focussed on what my visualisations should look like or whether I was missing a step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps it's because I waited until the afternoon to meditate - I struggle to concentrate even more after midday. Having said all this though, I did experience brief elation when giving good vibes during the Tonglen bit. Perhaps I should revisit this stuff when I'm more skillful or just when I'm more alert.

        <h5>How the SCARF model applied to my Phase Zero experience...<br>...and how I think it will affect bootcamp</h5>
        <p>
          Although I would argue that I'm totally unconcerned about <strong>S</strong>tatus, I realised how wrong I was when the book mentioned applying it to oneself: I am always comparing who I am with who I think I should be. Phase Zero has been good and bad for my own personal feeling of Status - when I've failed I've been pretty upset, but conversely I've succeeded a lot too and that's been absolute gold for me. I just need to cement everything I've learned these last nine weeks about dealing with failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>C</strong>ertainty is something everyone wants to feel. At times I've worried whether I'm good enough to proceed to bootcamp. Part of this worry has been down to my own need to improve my confidence; part of it has been a lack of communication from EDA. To their credit they are taking my feedback seriously. Joseph really helped my Certainty about my ability and about bootcamp, and for that I thank him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I crave <strong>A</strong>utonomy. It can be frustrating not to have it. In Phase Zero there's been an awful lot, and I can see the shortcomings of that (see Certainty). I think in bootcamp we'll have to work in teams much more than we have been, which will sacrifice Autonomy a little, but that's a good thing I think - after all everything EDA is driving us towards is about making us better people to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of Phase Zero, the overwhelming curiosity was my feelings of <strong>R</strong>elatedness. What would my cohort be like? Would they be super awesome technical people who were reluctant to share their expertise? Would they be nice people? Helpful people? Kind people? Turns out they certainly were, and I hope they think the same of me. I certainly tried my best. Now we have to do it all over agin when we merge with the Tieke cohort!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>F</strong>airness is a huge deal to me. Thankfully it's not been an issue so far. The work has been challenging but doable, the teachers and my cohort buddies have been kind and helpful. The emphasis on Process over Product really hammers this principle home - don't obsess about grades, but do your best and help others and you'll be alright. I hope those who dropped out or dropped back will be alright too.
