        <h3>May 5th - Self awareness leads to self confidence</h3>
        <h5>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness</h5>
        <p>
          The writer of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> argues that these are the same thing. But earlier in the chapter he briefly mentions using mindfulness techniques to help his self awareness and boost his self confidence - I think this is closer to the truth. Mindfulness is tool - perhaps <strong>the</strong> tool - that brings self awareness. It allows you to observe your emotions, thoughts, preferences, actions, and so on without judgement. You can then mindfully assess these characteristics - what they mean to you; how they affect you; how you can change or control them. This is self awareness. With enough self awareness, you can strengthen your mindfulness and the two become ever more symbiotic.
        </p>
        <h5>My experience of Body Scan and Journaling</h5>
        <p>
          I already have some experience of these things. When I first took and interest in meditation, I read a short book called "With each and every breath" that described a technique similar to Body Scan. I've incorporated it into my daily meditation as a means to get "into the zone". The emphasis in the book I read earlier was to observe the body sensations as a means to feeling your own breath energy, whereas <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> suggests using it to become better aware of your emotions and the effect on your physical self. This is an interesting idea and I look forward to using it outside of a meditation setting.
        </p>

          Journaling is basically keeping a diary isn't it? I used to do that, but I came across a few stumbling blocks: the inability for my writing to keep up with my thoughts; the tendency to self-edit as I go and therefore losing my train of thought; and the stark reality of your rawest thoughts being committed to paper - where you cannot ignore them - is intimidating. I also tend to overwrite, as anyone who's actually read these blogs might have figured out. It can be exhausting!
        </p>
        <h5>What I got from "Emotions are Not Me"</h5>
        <p>
          This was the most interesting bit, so it's a real shame it was covered so quickly. The subtle but crucial shift in thought from "I <strong>am</strong> this emotion", to "I <strong>feel</strong> this emotion" combined the cloud analogy is the real takeaway from this chapter; I look forward to being mindful of this truth.
