        <h3>April 14th - Reflections on Chapter One of "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
        <p>
          Without having a label for it, I've been trying to implement and practice Emotional Intelligence techniques for a while now. This is in response to deep seated, long held character traits that in blunt terms, I'm just utterly sick of. I want to be a better and happier person - for myself and those I care about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these EQ techniques I read about, some I came up with on my own. But having read the first chapter of a book like Search Inside Yourself is great because, even though a lot of it isn't new to me, it's good to know that others have experienced what I have and that I'm on the right track in terms of addressing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in Chapter One, the thing that kept jumping out at me is the concept of training: <em>"Happiness is a skill that can be trained"</em>; <em>"emotional skills are trainable"</em>; <em>"Brain. Trainable. Good."</em> The idea that you're not stuck in your ways, that you can change and be happy - that's gold right there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I already knew about training attention, about mindfulness and self awareness. About that split second between an emotion and your action, when you decide how to react. The trick as always is to be able to identify that moment and take a - very brief - moment to evaluate your emotional response.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's new to me in this chapter is about paying attention to the physiological response to emotion: the racing heart; the sweaty palms; the tense jaw. On reflection it seems obvious, but had never occurred to me up until now - I have been relying entirely on picking up the cues in my mind, with mixed results.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I will now try to pay attention to those physical clues to my emotional state so that I can:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Watch emotion as it rises</li>
              <li>Perceive its subtle changes</li>
              <li>and watch it cease.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the two minutes of mindfulness, I already meditate and try to carry this through into being mindful throughout the day - also with mixed success. I'll try out the two minutes and see how it goes!
