        <h5>...where Rich tries to explain what HTML, CSS, and the DOM are</h5>
        <p>
          As one of the dozen or so most-read bloggers in the kea cohort, I'm often asked "Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?", so you'd think I'd have a ready answer for that one, wouldn't you?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the reality is, that as far as the DOM goes, I only half understand it, and that may be a generous appraisal. But first, let me explain HTML and CSS. Boy, can I do that for your average Joe or Jane - probably because it's not so complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          To beat that long-dead horse, they're kind of like a house. HTML is the structure of the house - the foundations, the framing, the windows, doors, plumbing and wiring. It's all the stuff that makes a house a house. To a non technical person, the most obvious part of a web page's structure that HTML is responsible for is the text they read or the images they see.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS on the other hand, is the fun part. In our hypothetical house, it's the paint, the carpets, the tasteful lino and tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, and that moth eaten old Nirvana poster on the garage wall. It's also what tells us where the furniture goes. On a website, it's the colours and fonts and the position of all the bits and pieces you see like your menus and headings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM is kind of like a combination of the architect, the tradesmen, and the council. It defines the way the house is structured to the people in it and the way they access and interact with it - which way the windows and doors open, how the plug sockets and taps work, or whether you can build a deck or knock a hole through the wall between the dining the living room. In basic technical terms, the DOM instructs any programs accessing the web page about how it's structured, what it's made of, and how it behaves. Phew! Am I close?
        </p>
        <h5>... and where Rich talks about boxes</h5> 
        <p>
          As an aside, you're probably wondering about boxes, and I'm itching to tell ya!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Box Model is a simple way of explaining how web pages are laid out. Basically, everything is boxes. The header is a box, the menu is a box, the text is boxes, the pics are all boxes. EVERYTHING is boxes. Even the things that don't look like boxes - circles and triangles, for example - are all boxes too. Don't believe me? Here's a pic: <br>
          <img src="../blog/imgs/see-all-boxes.jpg" alt "I told you everything was boxes" class="u-max-full-width">
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want a weird shape, it's gotta fit in one of those boxes. It just the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Boxifying' design is simply a way of looking at the potential design of a site, and visualising where the boxes should be and what they will contain. Everyone does this differently, but some people might like to sketch the boxes by hand, some might print out the design and cut it into box-shaped bits, some might use a graphical design program. Really, it can be whatever floats your boat. The point is that if you can figure out how many boxes there are and where they go, it makes it much easier to build your site. Because, y'know, EVERYTHING IS BOXES.
