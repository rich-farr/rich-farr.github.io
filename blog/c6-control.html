        <h3>May 13th - Self-Regulation, and how to do it</h3>
        <p>
          Ok, now we're getting to the good stuff. I know myself enough to know that I want to change, but have always struggled with the "how?". The heat of the moment is usually the last time that you feel mindful of what you're doing, so overcoming that is the real trick.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new words and concepts in Chapter 5 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> aim at helping the reader identify their "triggers" at the moment they happen. Now I feel like I have a few new tools that I can repeat to myself, mindfully, when it counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bit that really stuck with me is the <strong>S</strong>i<strong>B</strong>erian <strong>N</strong>orth <strong>R</strong>ail<strong>R</strong>oad. It's an easy mnemonic that goes as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stop</strong> (or the <strong>"Sacred Pause"</strong>): This is the beauty of it - the most important bit is right here at the beginning. If you can stop when you get wound up about something, it gives you space to do the rest.</li>

          <li><strong>Breathe</strong>: Self explanatory really. Concentrate on the breath, be mindful, then move on.</li>

          <li><strong>Notice</strong>: Take the time to really feel what your body is doing - the rapid heartbeat, the sweaty palms, the sick feeling in the stomach.</li>

          <li><strong>Reflect</strong>: This is for once you're past the danger zone. Basically, "what set me off, and most importantly, why?"</li>

          <li><strong>Respond</strong>: With the kindest, most positive response.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are lots and lots of nuggets in this chapter. <em>Meshing</em> is where you imagine yourself to be porous, and the strong emotion passes straight through you. You can <em>Befriend</em> your emotions, so that they do not control you. Seeing <em>positives in your triggers</em> - after all, without them you can't identify where your problems lie, and therefore can't take steps to fix them. <em>Writing on water</em> is a beautiful euphemism for letting go. <strong>Grasping</strong> what you love ignores the reality of loss and change, while <strong>Aversion</strong> denies the need to confront what you do not. <em>Don't feed the monsters</em>, <em>Don't feel bad about feeling bad</em>, <em>Know when you are not in pain</em> - so many good, useful tidbits in here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one conundrum is that with so many new tools, what then to focus on? And how to remember it all?
