        <h3>Comparing JavaScript to HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>     
          Javascript is a big deal on today's web. Where HTML makes up a site's basic structure and CSS makes it look nice, Javascript is a programming language that makes the site actually *do* things. It makes modern webpages dynamic - all those moving menus and buttons, maps you can scroll through and zoom and and out of, image slideshows, and so on. They're all controlled, changed and moved about by Javascript. 
        </p>
        <h3>Explaining control flow and loops</h3>
        <p>
          These are ways of telling a computer do something under certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good example of control flow is the 'if / else' statement. This is where a computer is told to check <em>if</em> something is true, and if so, go do something. If it's false, the computer is often told to do something <em>else</em>. <em>If</em> statements can be chained together to make the computer check if a whole bunch of conditions are true before it gives up. It's like saying <em>if</em> you have bread, and <em>if</em> you have butter, and <em>if</em> you have peanut butter, make a sandwich, or <em>else</em> you should get takeaways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops are instructions that tell a computer to keep doing something until a condition is no longer true. There are two kinds, the <em>for</em> loop and the <em>while</em> loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would use a <em>for</em> loop if you have an idea how many times the loop will need to run before it stops. It's like exercise: do one press-up, then a second, then a third, and so on until you've done twenty.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand a <em>while</em> loop carries on looping until a specified condition is no longer true. It's like waiting for a bus. Look at all the oncoming buses until you see a number 3, then stop looking for buses and get on!
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to careful with loops though - if you write 'em wrong they can loop forever and that'll make your browser crash!
        </p>
        <h3>What's the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are really useful - they store different kinds of data in neat table-like structure. Very organised n'all, but it's just data such as numbers or phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object literals are similar, but they allow you to store data in a customised, more human, readable, real-world form. They allow you to say "This is a person with a name, and the name is 'Bob'."; or "This is a dog. This dog is a 2 year old german shepherd."
        </p>
        <p>
          With Arrays, it's like looking online for a cellphone, and the site says "we have this many of this model at our store". With Objects, it's like a page that lists all the phones, AND their specs, features, price, stock levels, reviews, and so on.
        </p>
        <h3>Functions: what they are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are quite simply a way of repeating an action as many times as you like without having to write a separate bit of code for each. You can use them to do all sorts of tedious stuff that computers are great for, like calculations, searches, and adding, deleting or amending data. They're a bit like how a printer replicates a document so that you don't have to do it longhand over and over!
