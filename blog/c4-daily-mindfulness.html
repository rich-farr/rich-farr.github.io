        <h3>May 1st - Ruminations on Chapter 3 of "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
        <h5>What I learned from a 'mindfulness conversation'</h5>
        <p>
          I did this with my wife. I think we learned that we both worry that we don't talk to each other enough. There's a danger of complacency in marriage where you assume you have all the time in the world to talk, and as a consequence just never getting around to it and you'll somehow find yourselves estranged. We agreed that we're not even close to that point. Even though we are introverts and enjoy alone time but we are not isolated from one another, but we can always interact more, and more mindfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our conversation extended well outside the boundaries of the exercise and we chatted at the kitchen table for an hour and really enjoyed ourselves. I realised that I can have a mindful conversation pretty easily if I choose to - but that's the trick isn't it? You have to decide not to live so much in your own head and actually make that effort to really listen to another person.
        </p>
        <h5>Which techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
        <p>
          "Do less than you can" is an interesting idea. I think I already do this - I aim for 20 minutes of mindfulness meditation every day, but can do more. I often do go beyond the twenty minutes if I'm really "feeling it" but there's no pressure or obligation on myself to push beyond that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "taking one breath a day" concept is a good one that I will use to try and extend my mindfulness beyond sitting. I am already trying to do that, but in a scattershot way. If I can tell myself to take that one mindful breath, it's a way of formalising the effort and entrenching it. Hopefully I can build from there and make it a habit.
        </p>
        <h5>Other musings</h5>
        <p>
          Walking meditation sounds great. I often use walking as a means of clearing my mind and relaxing, but in a totally non-mindful way - I daydream. It's not much of a stretch to try and turn that 180 and use the time to meditate. It would be cool to combine it with the concept of "open attention" - with all the stimulus going by on a walk, what better time to practice?
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I am already experiencing 'sukha' occasionally when I am sitting. I quite often get an intense feeling of joy not long after starting, which unfortunately I cannot yet sustain. I did have a curious experience recently of utter hilarity at the absurdity of a random thought that passed through my head - I had to struggle to keep myself composed and mindful for a long time and even now when I think if it, I want to giggle. That's probably my best encounter with sukha so far. More!
