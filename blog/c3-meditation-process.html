        <h3>April 22nd - Cultural Musings</h3>
        <h5>How 'Process Over Product' affected the way I tackled my site redesign and rebuild</h5>
        <p>
          I have to admit I struggled to keep it in mind. I would often remember it, but I was so focussed on figuring out the next problem that I would dive 'into the rabbit hole' and forget. To be fair on myself though, if the whole process is about learning, well then I certainly learned a lot of  new stuff. If it's about being comfortable with imperfect products... well, I have a ways to go on that one. My site *isn't* perfect, but I can't pretend those niggles don't annoy me. But hey, I *did* leave it in an imperfect state and I haven't gone back to fix it up, so...
        </p>
        <p>
          I also didn't timebox at all. Should try harder on that one. Overall, I give myself a B on 'Process over Product'.
        </p>
        <h5>What I thought about meditation before reading chapter 2 of 'Search Inside Yourself'</h5>
        <p>
          A lot! I already do 20+ minutes a day. It's a very positive addition to my life and I really enjoy it. It's amazing how quickly your meditation skill improves when you do it regularly.
        </p>
        <h5>New things I've learnt about meditation</h5>
        <p>
          Taking five seconds between stimulus and reaction is a good idea. I often struggle with itches and sometimes with my feet going to sleep. A more skillful approach to dealing with this will help.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also re-learned some of the seven points about posture. I do most of them already - my main focus is on sitting 'arrow' straight and keeping myself free from physical tension.
        </p>
        <h5>Suggested meditation techniques that stood out</h5>
        <p>
          Not much - I'm already familiar with a lot of it. But it's good to reinforce the ideas about basic technique ("follow your breath...") and dealing with distraction ("Acknowledge..."), and also to remember that there's no such thing as bad meditation - it's all "flexing your mental muscles".
        </p>
        <h5>Extra musings</h5>
        <p>
          Search Inside Yourself is an interesting, easy read. I'm looking forward to checking out the later parts. I hope it has a fair bit to say about insight - I'm sure it will.
