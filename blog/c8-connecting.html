        <h3>May 26th - Search Inside Yourself Chapter 7: Trust and Empathy</h3>
        <h5>Insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity</h5>
        <p>
          The Pyramid of Dysfunction is a good illustration. I think back to places I've worked and remember the different levels in action. Sadly this behaviour is very common - overcoming it requires near-universal "buy-in". Perhaps if more managers were aware of it and led efforts to foster trust, empathy and kindness, others would follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like a lot of the attitudes talked about in this section and try my best to live them. I want to automatically assume that others are good people and remember that they are human beings "just like me". I want to give people the benefit of the doubt and listen empathetically as well as mindfully.
        </p>
        <h5>Loving Kindness meditation and "Just Like Me"</h5>
        <p>
          I've been using the metta bhavana practise (without knowing the fancy name) to begin my meditation sessions the whole time I've been doing it - I read about it when I was first researching meditation techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          I start by wishing myself happiness, freedom from pain and suffering, and so on. Next, I extend that to my wife, then to friends and family. After that, to the people of Wellington, then New Zealand, then the world in an expanding bubble of kindness. I finish by extending my wishes to all living beings on the planet, in the galaxy and the universe beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to address people I don't like specifically, but I figured that just including them with everyone else was better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the idea of using this technique and "Just Like Me" in other parts of my life, especially after conflict. That's when you really need it.
        </p>
        <h5>The Political Awareness Exercise</h5>
        <p>
          I often had mini conflicts with a manager about performance and development plans. My "I'm 100% right about this" bit:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "This is a pointless box ticking exercise designed to make it look like we're accountable. We are trying to assess performance using entirely arbitrary 'measures' that will be glossed over if not met, or are so vague as to be meaningless. We do abstract stuff here that can't be measured as if we're making widgets. This just enables managers to avoid making simple subjective calls about their direct reports and if they're not doing stuff as basic as that, then what's the point of them? Also I don't care about my development - isn't it good enough that I'm a safe pair of hands? Why do I have to pretend I'm interested in climbing the ladder when I don't want what's at the top of it?"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          My boss's "100% right" rejoinder:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "I don't do this just to annoy you. I have to do this as part of my job. I cannot unilaterally decide not to do it - it's part of what <em>I'm</em> evaluated on. We have to try and measure performance because we're a public sector orgnaisation and we have to be accountable to the public. We can make the metrics more meaningful if we put in a bit of effort. Even then, the effort is not much considering that you have to do this once every four months. As for your development, the organisation wants people to progress; if not here then elsewhere. I also want you to develop and progress because I know you're not happy in your role and I would like you to enjoy your work."
