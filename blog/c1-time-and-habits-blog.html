          <h2>April 8th - Reflections on Time and Habit Techniques</h2>

            <p>Of the techniques and methods mentioned in the resources, I already use meditation and mindfulness. I currently do 20 minutes of mindful meditation each day, usually after my morning coffee. When I first started I did it immediately after getting up but my sleep-fog got in the way. Now I get to it after coffee. It helps! I love meditating and could do more of it, but I guess there's only so many hours in the day. I've always had a distractable and mile-a-minute mind, so the feeling of calm and at peace afterward is like waking from a pleasant dream.</p>

            <p>I've incorporated meditation as a major part of my "project" to become a better person, along with mindfulness. I'm weaker at the latter though. I still haven't managed to make it my default mind state outside of meditation. My mind still wanders a lot, but at least I have the meditative technique of snapping my attention back into the present to call on.</p>

            <p>I've also heard of the fixed vs growth mindset. Very interesting! As someone who grew up constantly hearing how smart he was, the fixed mindset was strong with me. It meant that when things suddenly stopped just working out easily for me, that being smart isn't enough, I was confused and angry. The growth mindset enables me to try and achieve things I always assumed were beyond me, like playing the guitar and meditating.</p>

            <p>Of the other techniques, "making it big by starting small" makes a lot of sense. Doing small things also makes starting things easier, which has always been a real challenge for me.</p>

            <p>I like the "7 counterintuitive ways" guy's emphasis on NOT emphasising productivity. Man, he really banged that drum didn't he? I loved it.</p>

            <p>Flow is great; who doesn't love being in the zone? The trick is getting there. More research is required. I'll look into timeboxing too, although I'm wary of systems that are too rigid.</p>
